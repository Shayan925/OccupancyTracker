# Hack the Valley 2021 Project

## Inspiration
There are many facilities with a limit of how many people can enter. Possibly because of COVID-19 (health-restrictions) or there is simply not enough space. At our high-school's library there is a 140 person limit and it inspired us to make an occupancy tracker to try and help the librarians keep track of the number of students entering and leaving, so they don't have to manually do it.
